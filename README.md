# RhombixTechnologies_TITANIC-CLASSIFICATION

## Introduction
The **Titanic Classification** is a data science and machine learning project that attempts to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster or not depending on different features including age, gender, ticket class, and fare paid. For this project, we will use the Titanic dataset that is available from Kaggle, and we will perform data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and machine learning modeling (to make predictons).

## Objectives
- Conduct **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** to understand the dataset.
- Prepare the data by handling **missing values**, **outliers**, and **categorical variable encoding**.
- Build and evaluate **classification models**.
- Improve the model with **hyperparameter tuning**.
- Interpret model results and derive insights on survival factors.

## Dataset Description
The dataset for this project was retrieved from the **Kaggle Titanic Competition**. It contains passengers’ details before boarding the Titanic, including whether they survived, their personal information, and travel details. 

### Key Features:
- `PassengerId` – Each passenger is given a unique identification number.
- `Survived` – Survival status (0 = No, 1 = Yes).
- `Pclass` – Represents ticket class (1st, 2nd or 3rd)
- `Name` – Full name of the passenger.
- `Sex` – The Passenger's gender.
- `Age` – The Passenger's age.
- `SibSp` – Number of siblings/spouses the passenger was traveling with
- `Parch` – Number of parents/children the passenger was traveling with
- `Ticket` – Ticket reference number.
- `Fare` – Price of the Ticket
- `Cabin` – Cabin number (if available).
- `Embarked` – Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton).

## Project Workflow

### Data Preprocessing
- **Handling Missing Values**: Imputed missing ages based on passenger class, filled missing embarkation ports, and utilized available cabin information.
- **Feature Engineering**: Created additional features such as **family size** and extracted **title** from passenger names.
- **Encoding Categorical Data**: Converted categorical variables (e.g., `Sex`, `Embarked`) into numerical values.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Analyzed dataset trends using visualizations.
- Explored survival rates based on **gender, class, and age groups**.
- Examined the relationship between **ticket fares and class levels**.
- Studied correlations among features.

### Machine Learning Models
Implemented and compared the performance of multiple classification models:
- **Logistic Regression**
- **Decision Tree Classifier**
- **Random Forest**
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
- **Gradient Boosting (XGBoost, LightGBM, etc.)**

### Model Evaluation & Hyperparameter Tuning
- Evaluated models using **accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, support, Confusion Matrix**.
- Performed **hyperparameter tuning** to optimize model performance.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Data Processing**: Pandas, NumPy
- **Data Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn
- **Notebook Environment**: Jupyter Notebook

## Results & Insights
- The best-performing model achieved an accuracy of **80%** (*update with actual accuracy*).
- Key survival factors:
  - **Gender**: Females had a higher survival rate than males.
  - **Class**: 1st class passengers had a better survival rate.
  - **Age**: Children had higher survival rates than adults.
- Feature importance analysis indicated that survival chances were significantly affected by the presence of **family members**, **ticket class**, and **fare paid**.

## Future Improvements
- Enhance accuracy by experimenting with **deep learning models**.
- Improve model performance with **feature selection techniques**.
- Explore **stacking ensemble learning** to boost predictions.
